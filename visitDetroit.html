							<p class="t-d">OVERVIEW</p>
							<p>&emsp;This project represents a collaborative effort with Visit Detroit, Detroit's official tourism bureau, aimed at developing an innovative city tourism Augmented Reality (AR) application. With ARI, the XR club at the University of Michigan, we are crafting an immersive digital experience that showcases Detroit's vibrant culture and attractions for the 19 million tourists who come yearly.</p>
							<p class="t-d">DEVELOPMENT STACK</p>
							<p>&emsp; Our technical approach involves Unity(C#) and Google's ARCore Geospatial API. Through this, we are demonstrating the feasibility of AR navigation, precise device localization, and the integration of AR anchors to seamlessly overlay digital content onto the cityscape.</p>
							<p class="t-d">MY ROLE</p>
							<p>&emsp;In my current role for this project, I serve as the lead designer overseeing the UI/UX aspects. Simultaneously, I play a vital role in developing the code responsible for device localization, a crucial element in the presentation of AR projections on buildings.  </p>
							<p class="t-d">DETAILS</p>
							<p>&emsp;It is currently in the works as of Fall 2023 with the concepting phase finishing in September and the building phase to run from October - December.</p>
							<p>&emsp;Here's the Figma draft I've designed for the conceptual app: </o>
