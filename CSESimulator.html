							<p>&emsp;CSE Simulator was created in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
							<p>&emsp; This project on the surface is about sillier themes and interacting with the fun objects around in the enviroment. However to make it more meaningful, my partner and I decided to explore the theme of imposter syndrome as well, as this often goes hand in hand with everyone pursuing a career in tech.</p>
							<p>&emsp;To implement this idea, by taking advantage of the Among Us model we imported, we thought it would be cool to take advantage of the original game's properties too of “others looking for the imposter” and having the user “play the imposter”. We added vents to vent the player into the “imposter room” and back to the main room. The player being able to vent sets the identity of the player to be the imposter(because only the imposter can vent in the original game). Because of this, we can build the contradiction/ the realization for the player that “they aren’t the imposter” once they vent into the imposter room. Inside the imposter room, on the computer screen, we made a custom material visual that reminds the user they aren’t the imposter. In addition, we add posters with imposter-syndrome-related graphics and links that bring the user to other resources. In addition, we added imposter-syndrome-related dialogue to all of the NPCs too.
