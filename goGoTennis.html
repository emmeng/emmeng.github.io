							<p>&emsp;This project is created in Unity with a group of 5 people.</p>
							<p>&emsp;GOGO TENNIS is a fitness app that encourages people to stay active through a multiplayer tennis game. With this, users will be able perform physical activities within the comfort of their own home with devices they already have, making it an accessible service for many.</p>
							<p>&emsp;GOGO TENNIS requires three devices to play, one computer to host the match room over the local network, and two phones that join as player clients. The library we used to make multiplayer possible and build this architecture was through Unity Netcode as it has high level level function calls developers can make to allow for server-client communication.</p>
							<p>&emsp;To reflect real-time racket swings, we use the user's phone sensor, the gyroscope, to compare the relative change per frame and accurately update the racket to the user.</p>
