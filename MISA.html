								<p class="t-d">OVERVIEW</p>
									<p>&emsp;MISA, short for "Mock Interview Simulator Assistant," is a single-scenario VR behavioral interview training software designed for the PICO headset.  This is our game design document submission  for the 2023 PICO Dev Jam.</p>
								<p class="t-d">AWARD</p>
								<p>&emsp;We won both 1st Place as well as the best Non-Game App category in the 2023 PICO Dev Jam.</p>
								<p class="t-d">MY ROLE</p>
								<p class="n-m"><i>Development</i></p>
								<p>&emsp;I contributed to conceptualizing the idea and its design. Additionally, I modeled both the office and home scenes and created short animations, such as the Umi animation(MISAâ€™S creature form) in Blender. I then created UI mockups and colored all of  the artwork. Lastly, I developed the presentation slides and used Premiere Pro to produce our video submission.</p>
								<p class="t-d">DEVELOPMENT STACK</p>
								<p>&emsp;For this project we used Blender, Figma, Procreate, Mixamo, and Adobe Premire Pro</p>
								<p class="t-d">DETAILS</p>
								<p>&emsp; MISA takes the form of a friendly entity that can transform into a human figure to present scenarios and evaluate users' responses to various interview questions. Our aim was to create a character that embodies the concept of adaptability, while also serving as a central point of user engagement. The choice of a jelly-like creature is symbolic of its capacity to transform, mirroring the user's journey of self-improvement through practice. Using AI, MISA provides dynamic interview questions and engages in real-time conversations, customizing its responses to user input for a more lifelike simulation. MISA is able to mimic both remote and in-person interview scenarios and uses a diverse set of trackers from the PICO interaction pack to assess non-verbal cues, including hand gestures and facial expressions.</p>
