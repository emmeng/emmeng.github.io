							<p>&emsp;Midnight Train was created using Firebase, JQuery, JavaScript, CSS, and html.</p>
							<p>&emsp;The goal of our website, titled Midnight Train, is to help improve the mood and well being of the user. To do so, our website immerses the user by placing them on a train traveling in space that has no specific destination. Once the user, a ghost of the user’s selected color, boards the train, the user has access to a variety of features to help them relax and decompress. Our main features (located in the menu button) include journaling, listening to their own Spotify playlist, doing a breathing exercise, and chatting with other users. With the journaling feature, the user can reflect on their day and how they feel. If the user doesn’t know what to write about, the user can follow the guided prompt that the journal entry provides. With the Spotify feature, the user can play the music that they want to play through Spotify, allowing the train to become more of their own personal space, rather than listening to our standard lofi background music. The breathing exercise feature allows the user to follow a guided breathing exercise with the intent to destress and increase user focus. Our chatting feature(not implemented completely as it only allows users to connect to a single room), lets users talk with others who would like to share their feelings. Through the train interface, our website also offers a lot of other interactive features such as sitting and gazing outside the window of the train, randomly generating positive quotes by clicking on the posters, and chatting with the conductor to give the user’s a more comfortable, interesting, and novel experience.
