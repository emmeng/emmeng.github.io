							<p>&emsp;This project was created in Unity during the 3 day MIT REALITY HACK XR Hackathon with a team of 5.</p>
							<p>&emsp;Cygnus is a virtual experience that immerses people in the personal story of one of our team members, Zelda. By visiting an important place associated with Zelda's root culture, the audience can help Zelda retrieve her memory to see how her past affected the present, and to look into the future. For this hackathon, we built one of the 9 memory fragments represented by the constellation Cygnus.</p>
							<p>&emsp;We loved the idea of visiting a landmark using the Looking Glass Portrait and interacting with it with hand controls using the Leap Motion Controller. Keeping these two technologies in mind, we wanted to center our idea on the hackathon's key theme this year, presence. To us, presence is a 3 dimensional concept that is made up of the past, present, and future.</p>
							<p>&emsp;We constructed a workflow between Unity3D, Looking Glass Portrait, and Leap Motion Controller. We applied Looking Glass and Ultraleap plugin for Unity to build out our program. On the design side, we used Figma, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Audition, Adobe Premiere Pro, and Blender.</p>
