							<h1>Cygnus</h1>
							<p class="t-d">OVERVIEW</p>
							<p>&emsp;Cygnus is an immersive virtual experience that offers a personal narrative, delving into the compelling life story of our team member, Zelda. Embark on a journey to a culturally significant location, where your engagement will play a pivotal role in helping Zelda recover her memories, shedding light on the past's influence on the present and providing glimpses into the future. This project, developed in Unity, displayed on the Looking Glass, during the MIT REALITY HACK 2023 XR Hackathon, represents one of the 9 memory fragments within the Cygnus constellation, created by our dedicated team of 5 in just 3 days.</p>
							<p class="t-d">MY ROLE</p>
							<p>&emsp; I contributed to 3D modeling, visual design, environment creation, storytelling development, and also helped successfully integrated the Leap Motion controller system with Unity.</p>
							<p class="t-d">DEVELOPMENT STACK</p>
							<p>&emsp;We created a smooth workflow connecting Unity3D, Looking Glass Portrait, and the Leap Motion Controller. Our program was developed utilizing Unity, enhanced by Looking Glass and Ultraleap plugins. For design purposes, we employed Figma, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Audition, Adobe Premiere Pro, and Blender.</p>
							<p class="t-d">DETAILS</p>
							<p>&emsp;We structured our system based on our fascination with the idea of using the Looking Glass Portrait to explore a landmark while interacting with it through hand controls from the Leap Motion Controller. Our approach aligned with this year's hackathon theme, "presence," which, to us, signifies a multi-dimensional concept encompassing the past, present, and future.</p>
