							<p>1:AM Train is a reimagined  VR version of a project I did one year ago called Midnight Train.</p>
							<p> Like Midnight Train, users are ghosts that can rid a subway train traveling on an infinite path. With the spatial freedom of VR, users are actually able to physically travel to different stations that provide wellbeing activities for users.</p>
							<p>All models were created by our team.</p>
							<p><b>Metro Dawn</b></p>
							<p>When the user first enters our application, they will be greeted by the conductor, where they receive a ticket to aboard our train. They are then introduced to the home station, Metro Dawn. From here, the user can get on the train and travel to the different stations. On the train, the user can use our journal feature to record themselves expressing their thoughts and feelings for the day, and just let out whatever is on their mind.</p>

							<p><b>Sea Eleven</b></p>
							<p>Our second main attraction is the underwater environment, where users can relax and destress while swimming around and enjoying the tropical view. Here, users can also receive sensory feedback from interacting with different sea life and plants. </p>

							<br></br>
							<p><b>Golden Aster</b></p>
							<p>Lastly, our final station features a chatting area where users can anonymously talk with other online users. Currently, due to our short development time, our prototype does not feature multiplayer, but we have implemented an interaction here where users are able to make wishes and reflect on themselves under the sky.  </p>
